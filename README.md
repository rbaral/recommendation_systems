# Recommendation Systems

This repository contains information about recommendation systems from scratch. 
This repo is intended for anyone starting to learn about recommendation systems. 
We will introduce the basics of recommendation systems, providing theoretical and practical perspectives wherever required and possible.

We will also provide the details on the code and data that are used to create a working example of the illustrated recommendation systems.

Many resources were refered during I worked on this repo. I would like to acknowledge all the resources I refered while working on this repo.

# Following types of recommendations are included in this project:
